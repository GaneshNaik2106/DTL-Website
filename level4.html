            <p>Welcome to Level 4! In this level, you'll delve into applications of optical fibres.</p>
            <p></p>
            Real-time applications of optical fibers encompass various industries and technologies, leveraging their high-speed data transmission, reliability, and versatility. Some notable examples include:
            <br>
            <br>

            
            <b>Telecommunications:</b> Optical fibers form the backbone of modern telecommunications networks,
             enabling high-speed data transmission over long distances. They are used for voice, video,
              and internet services, including long-haul transmission between cities and undersea cables
               for international connectivity.
            <br>
            <br>

            <b>Internet Infrastructure:</b> Optical fibers are essential for internet infrastructure, facilitating the
             high-speed data transfer required for streaming services, cloud computing, online gaming, and e-commerce platforms.
              Fiber-optic connections deliver faster and more reliable internet access to homes and businesses.
            <br>
            <br>

            <b>Medical Imaging:</b> Optical fibers are utilized in medical imaging devices such as endoscopes, laparoscopes, and fiber-optic
             catheters. They enable minimally invasive procedures by transmitting light to illuminate internal organs and tissues,
              providing real-time visualization for diagnosis and treatment.

            <br>
            <br>

            <b>Sensors and Instrumentation:</b> Fiber-optic sensors are employed in various industries for monitoring and measurement
             applications. They offer advantages such as immunity to electromagnetic interference, high sensitivity, and the ability 
             to operate in harsh environments. Examples include temperature sensors for industrial processes, strain sensors for
              structural health monitoring, and chemical sensors for environmental monitoring.
            <br>
            <br>

            <b>Defense and Aerospace:</b> Optical fibers are used in defense and aerospace applications for communication, sensing, and imaging. 
            They are employed in aircraft, satellites, and military vehicles for high-bandwidth data transmission, secure communications,
             and remote sensing.
